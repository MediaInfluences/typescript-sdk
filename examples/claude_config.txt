# Claude Desktop Configuration for MCP Coupon Ecosystem

To connect Claude Desktop to the coupon-based MCP servers, add the following configuration 
to your Claude Desktop config.json file.

## Configuration Details

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": [
    {
      "name": "Client MCP Server",
      "url": "ws://localhost:3001/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Main MCP Server",
      "url": "ws://localhost:3002/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Reputation MCP Server",
      "url": "ws://localhost:3003/mcp",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration File Locations

- On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/config.json`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\config.json` 
- On Linux: `~/.config/Claude/config.json`

## Instructions

1. Start all three MCP servers:
   ```bash
   # Start these in separate terminal windows
   node examples/client-mcp-server.js
   node examples/main-mcp-server.js
   node examples/reputation-mcp-server.js
   ```

2. Find your Claude Desktop config file at one of the locations above.

3. If the file doesn't exist, create it with the JSON content above.

4. If the file already exists, merge the "mcp_servers" array with any existing entries.

5. Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes.

6. Claude should now connect to all three MCP servers and display their available tools.

## Working with the Coupon Ecosystem

### Client MCP Server (Port 3001)
This server helps you create client identities and coupons:
- `generateClientCertificate` - Create a new identity with a certificate
- `createCoupon` - Create a signed coupon for use with the Main MCP Server
- `sendToMainServer` - Send a request with a coupon to the Main MCP Server

### Main MCP Server (Port 3002)
This server verifies coupons and provides protected resources:
- `serverStatus` - Check server status
- `protected.getData` - Access protected data (requires valid coupon)
- `protected.getReputationData` - Get reputation data (requires valid coupon)
- `manageTrustedIssuers` - Manage trusted issuer list

### Reputation MCP Server (Port 3003)
This server tracks reputation data and verifies coupons:
- `verifyCoupon` - Verify a coupon and get reputation data
- `getReputation` - Get reputation data for an entity
- `fetchAndVerifyCoupons` - Fetch and verify coupons from other servers
- `manageTrustedIssuers` - Manage trusted issuers

## Testing the Ecosystem with Claude Desktop

1. Use the Client MCP Server to generate a certificate:
   ```
   Use the generateClientCertificate tool to create a new client identity.
   ```

2. Use the Client MCP Server to create a coupon:
   ```
   Use the createCoupon tool with the clientId from step 1.
   ```

3. Copy the generated coupon JSON.

4. Use the Client MCP Server to send a request to the Main MCP Server:
   ```
   Use the sendToMainServer tool with the coupon, specifying protected.getData as the toolName.
   ```

5. Check the reputation data in the Reputation MCP Server:
   ```
   Use the getReputation tool to see reputation data for your client identity.
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you have issues:
1. Make sure all three servers are running
2. Check that the URLs in config.json match your server addresses
3. Verify your firewall allows connections to ports 3001, 3002, and 3003
4. Check the server consoles for connection attempts
